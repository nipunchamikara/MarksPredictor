# MarksPredictor

This project is a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook which predicts the marks of a student who has studied for 7 hours using [student_scores.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipunchamikara/MarksPredictor/main/student_scores.csv) as the dataset.

Special thanks to [JDPrabasha](https://github.com/JDPrabasha) for their guidance and support in this project.
